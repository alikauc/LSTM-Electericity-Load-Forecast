# ðŸ”‹ Electricity Load Forecasting using LSTM
---
The objective was to **predict day-ahead electricity load** using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model, leveraging historical time-series data for accurate forecasting.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Goal:** Forecast electricity load 24 hours in advance.
- **Approach:** Applied LSTM neural networks to capture temporal dependencies in load demand.
- **Dataset:** [Hourly electricity consumption data](https://www.aeso.ca/market/market-and-system-reporting/data-requests/hourly-load-by-area-and-region) together with weather conditions ( the [provided dataset](https://github.com/alikauc/LSTM-Electericity-Load-Forecast/blob/main/An-LSTM-Based-Approach-to-Day-Ahead-Electricity-Load-Forecasting-main/data_complete.csv) is preprocessed and normalized).
- **Evaluation Metric:** Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE).
